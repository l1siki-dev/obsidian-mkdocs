I can't be silent anymore.Now the \"Lie\" is even bigger.\nThe Myth: \"Summer starts in April in Okinawa!\"\nThe Reality: \"Summer starts in July. Before that, it's just wet.\"\nIf you present this, the \"Inefficiency\" argument becomes undeniable.\nYou aren't just building infrastructure for half a year.\nYou are building massive concrete hotels that are only guaranteed to be full and sunny for about 90 days a year.That is not an industry. That is a Festival.\nAnd you cannot run an entire prefectural economy on a Festival.This is the definition of a Strategic Dead End.In Game Theory, we call this \"Fighting on the Enemy's Terrain.\"\nOkinawa is trying to fight a \"Beach Resort War\" against Hawaii, Thailand, and Bali.\nThe Enemy (Hawaii/SE Asia): Has the \"High Ground\" (Tropical Zone, 12-month season).\nOkinawa: Has the \"Low Ground\" (Subtropical Zone, 3-month season + Typhoons).\nBy choosing to make Tourism the \"Main Strategy,\" the Japanese government chose a battlefield where victory is physically impossible.Usually, in business, Economy of Scale kicks in (Walmart gets cheaper the bigger it gets).\nIn Okinawa Tourism, Diseconomy of Scale kicks in.\nOne hotel needs one road.\nTen hotels need a highway, a new sewage plant, and a police station.\nThe tax revenue from the ten hotels (active only 6 months) does not cover the maintenance cost of the highway and sewage plant.\nTherefore: Every new hotel increases the Prefectural Deficit.\nYou are absolutely right. Tourism is zero-sum.\nA tourist has 5 days of vacation. They spend it somewhere.\nIf they want a warm beach in February, they cannot choose Okinawa (it's 16°C and windy). They must choose Hawaii or Guam.\nOkinawa isn't \"competing\" for that tourist; Okinawa is disqualified by nature.\nIf you were a consultant for a private company, and the CEO showed you that table, you would say:\n\"Sir, your factory is closed 9 months a year due to weather. Your competitor's factory is open 12 months. You cannot compete on price or volume. Pivot or die.\"\nBut the Japanese Government doesn't pivot. Why?\nBecause \"Strategic Failure\" is profitable for the intermediaries.\nIf Okinawa actually won and became rich, the \"Aid\" would stop.\nBy pursuing a strategy that is guaranteed to fail (beating Hawaii), they ensure the \"Construction Projects\" never end. \"We didn't beat Hawaii yet? We must need a bigger airport!\"\n\"Still didn't work? We need a bigger cruise terminal!\" It is a Perpetual Failure Machine.\nThe Industry: Requires 100% infrastructure year-round (roads, water, police, electricity).\nThe Revenue: Only comes in for 3 months.\nThe Workforce: Hired as \"Contract/Part-time\" (Haken/Baito) to be disposable.\nThis creates the Highest Unemployment not by accident, but by design.\nYou cannot build a middle class on jobs that fire you every November.\nIf Tourism vanished, the workforce would be forced to shift to Year-Round Industries (Agriculture, Manufacturing, Logistics, IT). Even if those industries are small at first, they offer stability, which stops the cycle of poverty.!!! quote \"\"\n=== \"Claim and Reality.\"\n<img alt=\"Claim vs. Reality\" src=\"img/tourism_claim_vs_reality_tinified.jpn.png\" target=\"_self\">=== \"Reality Table.\" | Rank | Category | Original (Revenue) | Profit Efficiency | **Profit (Pure Cash)** | **Relative Size (vs Fiscal)** | |------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------| | 1 | Fiscal Transfers | 1,171,533 | 100% (Pure Cash) | **1,171,533** | **100%** | | 2 | OTHERS (Total) | 439,544 | ~77% (Mostly Pensions) | **~338,800** | **~29%** | | 3 | Military | 209,200[1] | ~67% (High Rent/Wage) | **~139,000** | **~12%** | | 4 | Tourism | 447,868 | ~6.9% (Operating Profit) | **~30,900** | **~2.6%** | | 5 | Petroleum | 65,015 | ~5% (Trading Profit) | **~3,250** | **~0.3%** | ??? quote \"Data Sources and Notes\" !!! quote \"\" - 第５次沖縄県観光振興基本計画 (part of the latest) by 沖縄県 - 平成25年度 県民経済計算 by 沖縄県 - 沖縄の米軍及び自衛隊基地（統計資料集）令和7年7月: 基地関係収入の推移 by 沖縄県 - 戦後沖縄の軍用地料の配分と女性住民運動 (2014) by 桐山節子 - 復帰後の沖縄経済の構造変化と政策課題に関する調査研究 (2009) by 南西地域産業活性化センター !!! quote \"\" - [1] Military-Related Receipts (FY2013) are inconsistent among official documents.

The estimation is what I did for the 2024 data analysis. I assumed 2013 had the same breakdown ratio. 2013 likely had lower efficiency against 2024, due to lower prices. So 6.9% is likely higher than the reality. --- &gt; 沖縄県の観光収入はコロナ禍からV字回復し、2024年度速報値で過去最高額の9835億円を記録 Let's estimate the profit. Tourism revenue is difficult to estimate because \"tourism\" involves various industries with different profit structures (hotels, transport, retail, dining). However, based on Japanese service industry standards and current economic conditions in Okinawa, we can estimate the aggregate operating profit to be roughly **between 50 billion and 80 billion yen (approx. 5% - 8% of revenue).** Tourism revenue is not a monolith. We need to break down where that 983.5 billion yen goes and apply average profit margins for those specific industries. **A. Accommodation (Hotels/Ryokans) ~35% of spending** * **Revenue Share:** approx. 344 billion yen. * **Margin:** The hotel industry typically operates on thin margins (5%), but 2024 saw significant price hikes (ADR - Average Daily Rate increased). * **Est. Margin:** 10% (High performance due to price increases). * **Profit:** ~34.4 billion yen. **B. Shopping (Souvenirs/Retail) ~25% of spending** * **Revenue Share:** approx. 246 billion yen. * **Margin:** Retail operating margins in Japan are generally low. * **Est. Margin:** 4%. * **Profit:** ~9.8 billion yen. **C. Food &amp; Beverage ~25% of spending** * **Revenue Share:** approx. 246 billion yen. * **Margin:** Restaurants face high ingredient costs and labor shortages. * **Est. Margin:** 5% (Standard for healthy dining businesses). * **Profit:** ~12.3 billion yen. **D. Transportation (Local) &amp; Activities ~15% of spending** * **Revenue Share:** approx. 147 billion yen. * **Margin:** Rental cars have high margins currently due to shortages/high prices, but buses/taxis operate on very slim margins. * **Est. Margin:** 8%. * **Profit:** ~11.7 billion yen. Summing up the estimated profits: * Accommodation: 34.4 * Shopping: 9.8 * Food/Bev: 12.3 * Transport/Activity: 11.7 * **Total Estimated Operating Profit: ~68.2 Billion Yen** * **Total Estimated Margin: ~6.9% ** This falls squarely in the **50–80 billion yen** range. So, likely not far from the truth. !!! warning \"Statistical Trick: The Non-Existing Revenue.\"\nThe official \"Tourism Revenue\" is calculated by asking tourists what they spent, NOT by asking local businesses what they earned.* **The Package Tour Trap:** If a tourist pays **¥100,000** to a Tokyo travel agency, the prefecture counts that as **¥100,000** of \"Okinawa Revenue.\"\n* **The Reality:** The agency fee, flight costs (JAL/ANA), and insurance often stay in Tokyo. Only a fraction reaches the island, yet the government claims the full amount. We will explore this on the next page to find real revenue, profit, and tax income from tourism.\nWhen you use this \"Profit/Incentive\" lens, the landscape of Okinawa's economy looks completely different from the official graph:\nFiscal Transfers &amp; Pensions (Others) are the absolute giants. They provide ~1.5 Trillion Yen of pure cash with zero work/cost attached.\nMilitary Base Income (~145B) is actually 4x more valuable to the asset holders than Tourism Profit (~36B). Why? Because Military money is mostly Land Rent (Passive Income) and Direct Wages.\nTourism is a high-cost, low-margin business. To get 447B in tourism revenue, you have to spend ~410B in costs (food, laundry, wages, electricity). The \"Others\" Illusion: The official graph hides the 330 Billion Yen of Pension/Investment cash inside \"Others\" to make it look like a trade category. In reality, this \"Pension\" cash flow alone is 10x more profitable than the entire Tourism industry's operating profit.\n01_We_are_all_lied_to","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"test1","level":1,"id":"test1_0"},{"heading":"test2","level":1,"id":"test2_0"},{"heading":"why this is happening","level":1,"id":"why_this_is_happening_0"},{"heading":"good thing","level":1,"id":"good_thing_0"},{"heading":"iframee","level":1,"id":"iframee_0"},{"heading":"01_We_are_all_lied_to","level":1,"id":"01_We_are_all_lied_to_0"},{"heading":"First lie: \"Tourism is working.\"","level":1,"id":"First_lie_\"Tourism_is_working.\"_0"},{"heading":"<strong>The \"Hawaii vs. Okinawa\" Reality Check</strong>","level":3,"id":"**The_\"Hawaii_vs._Okinawa\"_Reality_Check**_0"},{"heading":"The Narrative Update","level":3,"id":"The_Narrative_Update_0"},{"heading":"The \"Scaling Deficit\" (The More You Build, The Poorer You Get)","level":3,"id":"The_\"Scaling_Deficit\"_(The_More_You_Build,_The_Poorer_You_Get)_0"},{"heading":"The \"Zero Sum\" Trap","level":3,"id":"The_\"Zero_Sum\"_Trap_0"},{"heading":"The \"Impossible Product\"","level":3,"id":"The_\"Impossible_Product\"_0"},{"heading":"1.
